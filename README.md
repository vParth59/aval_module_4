# DEGEN TOKEN

This Solidity program implements an ERC20 token named "DEGEN" with the symbol "DGN." The token is designed specifically to facilitate the redemption of in-game purchases.

## Description

This Solidity program defines the "DEGEN" Token, an ERC20 token on the Avalanche blockchain with the symbol "DGN." It is designed for in-game transactions, enabling seamless redemption of virtual purchases. This code provides a foundational example of ERC20 token creation in Solidity, serving as an entry point for developers exploring blockchain-based solutions.

### Getting Started

To interact with the DEGEN Token, you can copy the contract on remix, compile it, and then fetch it from the given address on the fuji-c chain

The contract is deployed on the Avalanche Fuji-C chain at the address

```
npm i
```

in the terminal to install all the dependencies required.

To compile the code, run:

```
npx hardhat compile
```

To interact with the DEGEN Token smart contract, type in the terminal

```
npx harhdat run scripts/<filename>.ts --network fuji
```
